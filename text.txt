I want to optimize my `audio.py` code by removing unnecessary imports and avoiding duplicated functionality. The file currently imports the following modules:  

- `from aiHandler import AIHandler`  
- `from interruption import InterruptionHandler, ListeningState`  
- `from audio_utils import initialize_audio`  
- `from state_management import AudioState`  
- `from watchdog import WatchdogMonitor`  
- `from cleanup import CleanupHandler`  
- `from tts_handler import TTSHandler`  
- `from stt_handler import STTHandler`  
.  

**Important:** Please do not delete any part of `audio.py` unless it is confirmed to be duplicated in another file or completely unused. Ensure that all functionality in `audio.py` remains intact after refactoring.  

Your task is to:  
1. Check if all the listed imports are used in `audio.py`.  
2. Identify duplicated functions in `audio.py` and other files.  


Thank you!
