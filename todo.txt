my code curently should show only 1 time Listening .... and wait for user input. 


System Overview & States
The system operates in two main states:
FULL_LISTENING: The default state where it listens for all user input
INTERRUPT_ONLY: Active when sentnece is deemed complete and send to main ai model, only listens for interrupt commands
Detailed Process Flow
1. Initial Listening Phase
System starts in FULL_LISTENING state
Microphone constantly captures audio in small chunks (100ms)
Google Speech-to-Text converts these chunks to text in real-time
As user speaks, interim transcripts are generated and monitored
2. Sentence Completion Analysis
When speech is detected, the system:
Accumulates text until a pause is detected
Sends text to the AI analysis model to check if it's a complete sentence
Gets back true/false response
If TRUE: Waits 1 second before processing
If FALSE: Waits 2 seconds for potential additional speech
This prevents premature processing of incomplete thoughts
3. AI Processing Phase
Once a sentence is deemed complete:
System switches to INTERRUPT_ONLY state
Sends text to main AI model (GPT-4)
Receives response in chunks (streaming text)
Each chunk is immediately:
Converted to speech
2. Queued for playback
Played through speakers
This creates a more natural, flowing conversation
4. Interruption Handling
Voice Interruptions
System maintains a list of interrupt phrases like:
"stop"
"please stop"
"shut up"
"end"
"silence"
etc.
During INTERRUPT_ONLY state, all speech is checked against these phrases
When detected:
1. Immediately stops current audio
Plays short acknowledgment sound
Clears all queued audio
Returns to FULL_LISTENING state
.




in the end i want to see something like this:
(venv) manu@manu-HP-ProBook-440-G8-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/audio$ python audio.py

Starting audio transcription... Speak into your microphone.
Press ` (backtick) to interrupt at any time.
Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Final: "hello."

Processing triggered - Sentence complete: True, Silence: 1.0s

Changing state to INTERRUPT_ONLY for processing

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Final: "how are you?"

Processing triggered - Sentence complete: True, Silence: 1.0s

Changing state to INTERRUPT_ONLY for processing

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Final: "let's talk about some quantum physics."

Processing triggered - Sentence complete: True, Silence: 1.1s

Changing state to INTERRUPT_ONLY for processing

Interrupt command detected: 'shut up.'

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)

Listening... (Press ` to interrupt)
